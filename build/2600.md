## Disco

-  posted 4 weeks ago Yesterday I gave a talk at Black Hat about my recent research with Disco.

- (Thanks Bytemare for the picture.)

- I've introduced both the Strobe protocol framework and the Noise protocol framework in the past.

- So I won't go over them again, but I advise you to read these two blog posts before reading this one (if you care about the technical details).

- As a recap: 1.

- The Strobe protocol framework is a framework to build symmetric protocols.

- It's all based on the SHA-3 permutation (keccak-f) and the duplex construction.

- Codebase is tiny (~1000LOC) and it can also be used to build simple cryptographic operations.

## Bitcoin Miner NiceHash Hacked, Possibly Losing $62 Million in Bitcoin

- Breach occurred just prior to bitcoin's debut on two major US exchanges, the AP reports.Slovenia-based bitcoin mining company NiceHash has temporarily halted its operations while it investigates a security breach and determines how many bitcoins were stolen, the company announced Wednesday.

> "Clearly, this is a matter of deep concern and we are working hard to rectify the matter in the coming days.

- In addition to undertaking our own investigation, the incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are co-operating with them as a matter of urgency," NiceHash stated on its website.

- Potentially 4,736.42 bitcoins, with a value of $62 million, may have been plundered, based on a bitcoin wallet address circulated by NiceHash, reports CoinDesk, a publication that follows the blockchain industry.

- NiceHash's breach occurred prior to bitcoin's cryptocurrency debut on two major US exchanges, according to an AP report.

- On Sunday evening, bitcoin will trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and later this month on the CME Group's platform.

- Read more about the NiceHash breach here.

- Dark Reading's Quick Hits delivers a brief synopsis and summary of the significance of breaking news events.

## Man-in-the-Middle Flaw in Major Banking, VPN Apps Exposes Millions

- New research from University of Birmingham emphasizes importance of securing high-risk mobile apps.

- [This article was updated on 12/11 to clarify the Bank of America app cited by researchers was Bank of America Health] Researchers from the UK have uncovered a serious vulnerability in the way nine banking and VPN apps handle encrypted communication that puts tens of millions of users at risk of man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

- Among those impacted are two of the largest global banks - Bank of America and HSBC - as well as one of the world's most popular VPN providers, TunnelBear.

> "Our tests find that apps from some of the world's largest banks contain the flaw, which if exploited, could enable an attacker to decrypt, view and modify traffic - including log-in credentials - from the users of the app," write Chris Mcmahon Stone, Tom Chothia, and Flavio Garcia of University of Birmingham, who detailed the discovery in a paper released yesterday.

- The findings came as part of a study involving a new blackbox automated-testing mechanism the team came up with to find applications that implement TLS certificate-pinning but fail to verify the hostname, leaving them open to MitM attacks.

- Dubbed Spinner, the tool uses the Censys Internet scanning engine to scale up what has in the past been a costly, manual process to check.

- As a part of the release of their paper, the researchers also released Spinner under a Creative Commons License.

- The initial discovery of the nine applications came by way of a study using Spinner of 400 iOS and Android applications.

## Keylogger Found in HP Notebook Keyboard Driver

-   HP has released driver updates for hundreds of notebook models to remove debugging code that an attacker could have abused as a keylogger component.

- The keylogging code was present in the SynTP.sys file, which is part of the Synaptics Touchpad driver that ships with some HP notebook models.

> "The logging was disabled by default but could be enabled by setting a registry value," said Michael Myng, the security researcher who discovered the flaw earlier this year.

- That registry key is: HKLM\Software\Synaptics\%ProductName% HKLM\Software\Synaptics\%ProductName%\Default Malware devs can use this registry key to enable the keylogging behavior and spy on users using native kernel-signed tools, undetectable by security products.

- All they have to do is to bypass a UAC prompt when tweaking the registry key.

- There are tens of methods of bypassing UAC prompts currently available.

- Just some leftover debugging code "The keylogger saved scan codes to a WPP trace," said Myng.

- WPP software tracing is a technique used by app developers and is intended for debugging code during development.

## Rutkowska: Trust Makes Us Vulnerable

- Offensive security researcher Joanna Rutkowska explains why trust in technology can put users at risk.BLACK HAT EUROPE - London, UK - When a technology is described as "trusted" - for example, a trusted third party or trusted computing base - many people get the impression it's secure.

- Joanna Rutkowska, CEO and co-founder of Invisible Things Lab and the Qubes OS project, believes this is misleading.

> "In computer security, 'trusted' means this piece of code, or whatever is being trusted, is capable of destroying my whole security integrity," she said in her keynote entitled "Security Through Distrusting" here today at Black Hat Europe.

- She says we have too much trust in technology and this trust is leaving us vulnerable to attack.

> "When I call something 'trusted' I really mean something negative," she continued.

> "I don't want things to be trusted."

- Rutkowska emphasized the differences in calling technology "trusted," "secure," and "trustworthy."

- When something is secure, it's difficult to penetrate but not necessarily benign: even malicious things such as malware, backdoors, and botnets, can be secure, for example.

## Security Vulnerabilities in Certificate Pinning

-  Security Vulnerabilities in Certificate Pinning New research found that many banks offer certificate pinning as a security feature, but fail to authenticate the hostname.

- This leaves the systems open to man-in-the-middle attacks.

- From the paper: Abstract: Certificate verification is a crucial stage in the establishment of a TLS connection.

- A common security flaw in TLS implementations is the lack of certificate hostname verification but, in general, this is easy to detect.

- In security-sensitive applications, the usage of certificate pinning is on the rise.

- This paper shows that certificate pinning can (and often does) hide the lack of proper hostname verification, enabling MITM attacks.

- Dynamic (black-box) detection of this vulnerability would typically require the tester to own a high security certificate from the same issuer (and often same intermediate CA) as the one used by the app.

- We present Spinner, a new tool for black-box testing for this vulnerability at scale that does not require purchasing any certificates.

## New Android vulnerability allows attackers to modify apps without affecting their signatures

- A serious vulnerability (CVE-2017-13156) in Android allows attackers to modify the code in applications without affecting their signatures.

- The root of the problem is that a file can be a valid APK file and a valid DEX file at the same time.

- We have named it the Janus vulnerability, after the Roman god of duality.Janus vulnerabilityThe Janus vulnerability stems from the possibility to add extra bytes to APK files and to DEX files.

- On the one hand, an APK file is a zip archive, which can contain arbitrary bytes at the start, before its zip entries (actually more generally, between its zip entries).

- The JAR signature scheme only takes into account the zip entries.

- It ignores any extra bytes when computing or verifying the application's signature.

- On the other hand, a DEX file can contain arbitrary bytes at the end, after the regular sections of strings, classes, method definitions, etc.

- A file can, therefore, be a valid APK file and a valid DEX file at the same time.

## Nvidia announces $2,999 Titan V, 'the most powerful PC GPU ever created'

-  It seems like Nvidia announces the fastest GPU in history multiple times a year, and thats exactly whats happened again today; the Titan V is the most powerful PC GPU ever created, in Nvidia's words.

- It represents a more significant leap than most products that have made that claim, however, as it's the first consumer-grade GPU based around Nvidias new Volta architecture.

- That said, a liberal definition of the word consumer is in order here  the Titan V sells for $2,999 and is focused around AI and scientific simulation processing.

- Nvidia claims up to 110 teraflops of performance from its 21.1 billion transistors, with 12GB of HBM2 memory, 5120 CUDA cores, and 640 tensor cores that are said to offer up to 9 times the deep-learning performance of its predecessor.

- Also it comes in gold and black, which looks pretty cool.

- Our vision for Volta was to push the outer limits of high performance computing and AI.

- We broke new ground with its new processor architecture, instructions, numerical formats, memory architecture and processor links, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang says in a statement.

- With Titan V, we are putting Volta into the hands of researchers and scientists all over the world.

## The Jailbreaking Community Is Bracing for Google to Publicly Drop an iPhone Exploit

-  Until recently, there were many talented hackersknown as jailbreakerstrying to break into the iPhone to open up Apples notoriously closed operating system, and for the thrill of the challenge.

- The iPhone was, and still probably is, the most secure consumer computing device on the planet.

- The days of people dropping one-click iPhone jailbreaks on the internet are long gone.

- There are still security researchers hacking iOS, but the bugs they find are so rare that they often sell them to brokers for upwards of a million dollars.

- Because exploits are so valuable, its been a long time since weve seen a publicly accessible iPhone jailbreak even for older versions of iOS (let alone one in the wild for an up to date iPhone.)

- But a tweet sent by a Google researcher Wednesday has got the security and jailbreaking communities in a frenzy.

- The tweet suggests that Google is about to drop an exploit that is a major step toward an iPhone jailbreak, and other researchers say they will be able to take that exploit and turn it into a full jailbreak.

- It might seem surprising that an iPhone exploit would be released by Google, Apples closest competitor, but the company has a history of doing so, albeit with less hype than this one is garnering.

## Introducing ProtonMail Bridge, email encryption for Outlook, Thunderbird, and Apple Mail

-  Today we are officially launching ProtonMail Bridge, which brings easy-to-use email encryption to desktop email clients.

- Ever since the day that we first got the idea to create ProtonMail, one of the most enduring challenges has been how to do email security right while simultaneously making encrypted email easy enough to use for normal people.

- Since our early days working from the CERN cafeteria, we have been working tirelessly to address this specific problem.

- In the years since, we have made many great strides towards creating usable encrypted email, first with ProtonMails webmail interface and then with our award-winning iOS and Android secure email apps.

- However, one of our goals has always been to bring easy-to-use encrypted email to desktop.

- The problem is formidable.

- Desktop systems encompass multiple operating systems with dozens of popular email clients with their own adherents, and virtually none of them natively speak PGP, the email encryption standard upon which ProtonMail is built.

- Around two years ago, we created a small task force to tackle this challenge.

## How the Major Intel ME Firmware Flaw Lets Attackers Get 'God Mode' on a Machine

- Researchers at Black Hat Europe today revealed how a buffer overflow they discovered in the chip's firmware can be abused to take control of a machine - even when it's turned 'off.

- 'A recently discovered and now patched vulnerability in Intel microprocessors could be used by an attacker to burrow deep inside a machine and control processes and access data - even when a laptop, workstation, or server is powered down.

- Researchers who discovered the flaw went public today at Black Hat Europe in London with details of their finding, a stack buffer overflow bug in the Intel Management Engine (ME) 11 system that's found in most Intel chips shipped since 2015.

- ME, which contains its own operating system, is a system efficiency feature that runs during startup and while the computer is on or asleep, and handles much of the communications between the processor and external devices.

- An attacker would need physical, local access to a victim's machine to pull off the hack, which would give him or her so-called "god mode" control over the system, according to Positive Technologies security researchers Mark Ermolov and Maxim Goryachy, who found the flaw.

- And although Intel issued a security advisory and update for the vulnerability on November 20, Ermolov and Goryachy argue that the fix doesn't prevent an attacker from using other vulnerabilities for the attack that Intel also patched in the recent ME update, including buffer overflows in the ME kernel (CVE-2017-5705), the Intel Server Platform Services Firmware kernel (CVE-2017-5706), and the Intel Trusted Execution Engine Firmware kernel (CVE-2017-5707).

- All the attacker would have to do is convert the machine to a vulnerable version of ME and exploit one of the older vulns in it, they say.

- Those flaws "have been patched by Intel through its latest firmware release, but if an attacker has write access to the Management Engine region, they can downgrade to an older, vulnerable version of Management Engine and exploit a vulnerability that way," Goryachy told Dark Reading.

## Toucan play that game: Talking toy bird hacked

-  The same researchers whose hack on the My Friend Cayla doll prompted regulatory action have followed up with a hack on a talking toy robot bird.

- Creepy Cayla doll violates liberte publique, screams French data protection agency READ MORE Researchers from UK security consultancy Pen Test Partners found that it was childs play to turn the Teksta Toucan talking toy into a potty-mouth.

- In homage to The Fast Show the Toucan was induced to swear like Unlucky Alfs parrot, as the video (below) illustrates.

- We knew that the Toucan had much in common with My Friend Cayla and iQue, so had a go at the same attacks, explained Pen Test Partners Ken Munro.

- El Reg understands that Toucan is manufactured by the same vendor that makes iQue and Cayla, Genesis Industries Ltd of Hong Kong, and we have asked it for comment.

- Two hack methods were quickly uncovered.

- Firstly, the Toucan is a Bluetooth audio device.

- It has a microphone and speaker, so its possible to simply pair it to a Bluetooth audio device (laptop, phone etc) and play some audio through the Toucan.

## Google releases web app version of Chrome Remote Desktop

-    Google is trying to phase out Chrome Web Store apps, in favor of more modern (and cross-platform) Progressive Web Apps.

- One of the most well-known Chrome apps is Chrome Remote Desktop, a remote management tool similar to VNC or TeamViewer.

- While it was originally designed to give Chromebooks a proper remote desktop application, it has also become popular as a TeamViewer alternative.

- Today, Google has launched a beta of a new web-based Chrome Remote Desktop.

- Not only is it fully online, but it also has a brand new interface.

- I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of how much screen space it takes up, but Google could still be tweaking things.

- The old Chrome Remote Desktop The functionality of the app hasn't changed much.

- To remotely control your PC, you still have to install the 'Chrome Remote Desktop Host' program and allow it to run when your computer starts up (just like every other remote desktop tool).

- Photo:  Eva Dou/The Wall Street Journal          PUYANG, ChinaOne night this September, construction supervisor Chen Shouli fired off a joke in a chat group.

- Haha, he typed on his black iPhone 7, followed by an off-color wisecrack about a rumored love triangle involving a celebrity and one of Chinas most senior government officials.

- Four days later, he says, the police telephoned, ordering him in for questioning.

- I thought, I havent done anything wrong, have I?

## Explainer video shows how secure 256 bit security is

-  Hash functions are important in data security.

- SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm) converts text of any length to a 64-digit hexadecimal number.

- Play around with the hash generator here by copying and pasting text into it.

- Here's a Shakespeare quote:  Lifes but a walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more; it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

- The SHA-256 hash is:  CCF93A73CA8089926E3511F7FEDACB4450415E6726677BA071B9995FAF569F00 If you change a single character, the hash is completely different.

- If you take the end period off the quote, the hash becomes:  DD1912DD6274B91DCD3302D7C6C37FB52DCF7E0C516F39E6AD64ECB9FCBE9417 Hashes are "one-way" -- it's easy to generate a hash from any text, but there is no know way to convert a hash back into the source text.

## Domain Fronting with Meterpreter

-   Domain Fronting is a technique that is typically used for censorship evasion.

- It relies on popular Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) such as Amazons CloudFront to mask traffic origins.

- By changing the HTTP Host header, the CDN will happily route us to the correct server.

- Red Teams have been using this technique for hiding C2 traffic by using high reputation redirectors.

- For more information on Domain Fronting, please refer to this whitepaper Setting up CloudFront Log in to AWS, and navigate to CloudFront.

- You will need a domain name that you own, or acquired for free from a registrar like Freenom.

- Once you are logged into AWS, click Create Distribution.

- The Origin Domain Name will be the domain that you own.

-  Enumerates S3 buckets manually or via certstream Overview  First of all, credit to https://github.com/eth0izzle/bucket-stream for the certstream idea.

- Also, credit to all the vendor packages that made this tool possible.

- Not responsible for how you use this tool.

- Modes Certstream  Domain  Keywords  Features  Written in Go:  It's faster than python.

- No dependency hell and version locks (ie python 3 and requirements.txt, etc); easier to deploy, static binary, etc.

- Better concurrency.

- Punycode support for internationalized domains (S3 doesn't allow internationalized buckets; so this app just notifies and skips (certstream) or exits (domain mode)).

- Domain mode so that you can test individual domains.

## Hacked IV Pumps and Digital Smart Pens Can Lead to Data Breaches

- Researcher to reveal IoT medical device dangers at Black Hat Europe this week.An attack on a single IV infusion pump or digital smart pen can be leveraged to a widespread breach that exposes patient records, according to a Spirent SecurityLabs researcher.

- Saurabh Harit, managing consultant with Spirent, will present his findings on flaws in IV infusion pumps and digital smart pens at Black Hat Europe this week.

> "Perpetuators can use this patient information to file false insurance claims as well as to buy medical equipment and drugs using a fake ID.

- These products are then easily sold on the black market," Harit says.

> "What makes medical data more lucrative than the financial data is the low and slow detection rate of the fraud itself.

- While a credit card fraud can be detected and blocked in a matter of minutes these days, medical data fraud can go undetected for months, if not more."

- Harit has notified the affected IV infusion pump and digital smart pen vendors of the vulnerabilities, which have patched the flaws, Harit says he will not reveal the names of the companies or their devices.

- Smart Pen Problems "By far the most surprising thing we came across in our research was the amount of patient information that was available with the digital smart pen," Harit says.

## Chrome 63: Site Isolation, extension blocking and TLS 1.3

-  Its that time again!

- Sometime in the next week or so, Chrome OS will receive the latest milestone update and version 63 will begin rolling out to Chromebooks and Chrome devices everywhere.

- Per the natural order of things, the desktop version of Chrome updated this week and brought with is some stability and security enhancements but before you get too excited, they come at a cost and the currency is RAM.

- Site Isolation Since inception, the Chrome browser has implemented a Multi-process architecture which dedicates a single process per browser tab to contain crashes and bugs within the individual session.

- This increases Chromes stability by preventing full browser crashes being triggered by a single page fault.

- Site Isolation is an enterprise-focused upgrade to the Multi-process model meant to create even more stability while also making the browser more resistant to exploits.

- The current method of Multi-process rendering generally uses one process per tab but when an event in that tab triggers an action that opens a new page, those pages now share the same, singular process.

- Likewise, if multiple domains are visited within a single browser page, the one process is shared among all the events.

## The Creator of Signal Has a Plan to Fix Cryptocurrency

- In the early bitcoin years, proponents promised that you would soon be able to pay for anything and everything with cryptocurrency.

- Order pizza!

- Buy Etsy trinkets!

- Use a bitcoin ATM!

- While PayPal had existed for more than a decade, frictionless, social payment platforms like Venmo were just first taking off, and cryptocurrency seemed like a legitimate way for digital transactions to evolve.It didn't happen.

- Cryptocurrency remains confusing and challenging for the average person to acquire and manage, much less sell.

- And the protocols that underlie bitcoin and other mainstream cryptocurrencies like ethereum suffer significant scalability and transaction bottleneck issues.

- Visa currently processes about 3,674 transactions per second; the best bitcoin network might be able to process seven per second.But now the creator of the dead simple end-to-end encrypted messaging app Signal, Moxie Marlinspike, is on a mission to overcome those limitations, and to create a streamlined digital currency that's private, easy-to-use, and allows for quick transactions from any device.

## South Korea to hold emergency meeting on cryptocurrencies, measures ex

- SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Wednesday it may tax capital gains from cryptocurrency trading as global regulators worried about a bubble, with Australias central bank chief warning of a speculative mania that has seen the digital asset making rip-roaring gains.

- As bitcoin futures made their world debut on a U.S. stock exchange this week, policy makers have been forced to contend with cryptocurrencies becoming more of a mainstream play and the need to regulate them.

- The world's biggest and best known cryptocurrency, bitcoin BTC=BTSP, surged past $17,000 to new all-time highs this week, marking an almost dizzying 20-fold rise this year and feeding fears of a bubble.

- Australias central bank governor Philip Lowe warned on Wednesday the fascination with the assets felt like a speculative mania. The comments come days after his New Zealand counterpart said bitcoin appeared to be a classic case of a bubble, and cast doubt on its future.

- The chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday warned trading and public offerings in the emerging asset class may be in violation of federal securities law.

- Digital currencies are very popular across Asia, with many retail investors giving up their daily jobs to trade them full time in countries such as Japan and South Korea, which together make up for more than half the global trading volumes by some estimates.

- But the possibility of major losses if the bubble bursts and wild gyrations of 10-30 percent in a single day have instilled a sense of urgency among policymakers to come up with a regulatory response.

- In Seoul, after an emergency meeting on Wednesday, South Koreas government said it will consider taxing capital gains from trading of virtual coins and will also ban minors from opening accounts on exchanges, according to a statement obtained by Reuters ahead of its official release.

## TP-Link repeater firmware squanders 715 MB/month

-  You should probably avoid TP-Link products if youre on a tight bandwidth budget.

- By design, TP-Link firmware sends six DNS requests and one NTP query every 5 seconds, for a total of 715,4 MB per month.

- The firmware of some TP-Link repeaters  but not routers  including all 2017 models are very talkative on NTP, to a total of 715,4 MB per month.

- NTP is the network time protocol used to synchronize clocks across the web.

- To put this number in context: an always-on Windows device will use around 1,6 KB per month on NTP.

- TP-Links firmware doesnt have any sort of DNS caching, and they query DNS about 6 NTP server pool addresses every 5 seconds followed by an NTP request to one of them.

- An always-on Windows client sends 1 DNS and 1 NTP request once a week.

- (If you power cycle or suspend your device, it will send one additional request.)

## Nope, this isnt the HTTPS-validated Stripe website you think it is

-    EnlargeIan Carroll  For a decade, some security professionals have held out extended validation certificates as an innovation in website authentication because they require the person applying for the credential to undergo legal vetting.

- That's a step up from less stringent domain validation that requires applicants to merely demonstrate control over the site's Internet name.

- Now, a researcher has shown how EV certificates can be used to trick people into trusting scam sites, particularly when targets are using Apple's Safari browser.

- Researcher Ian Carroll filed the necessary paperwork to incorporate a business called Stripe Inc.

- He then used the legal entity to apply for an EV certificate to authenticate the Web page https://stripe.ian.sh/.

- When viewed in the address bar, the page looks eerily similar to https://stripe.com/, the online payments service that also authenticates itself using an EV certificate issued to Stripe Inc.

- The demonstration is concerning because many security professionals counsel end users to look for EV certificates when trying to tell if a site such as https://www.paypal.com is an authentic Web property rather than a fly-by-night look-alike page that's out to steal passwords.

- But as Carroll's page shows, EV certs can also be used to trick end users into thinking a page has connections to a trusted service or business when in fact no such connection exists.

## BlueBorne Attack Highlights Flaws in Linux, IoT Security

- Bluetooth vulnerabilities let attackers control devices running Linux or any OS derived from it, putting much of the Internet of Things at risk, including popular consumer products.Popular consumer "smart" products, including Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Samsung's Gear S3, are dangerously exposed to airborne cyberattacks conducted via Bluetooth.

- Researchers at IoT security firm Armis earlier this year discovered Blueborne, a new group of airborne attacks.

- The vulnerabilities let attackers take full control of any device running Linux, or OS derived from Linux, putting the majority of IoT devices at risk of exposure.

- The researchers discussed and demonstrated their latest findings at Black Hat Europe 2017, held last week in London.

- Vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth stack have been overlooked for the past decade, they explained.

- Bluetooth, often perceived as peripheral, could benefit attackers if they successfully break into a high-privilege device.

- As the researchers demonstrated, one compromised product can spread its attack over the air to other devices within Bluetooth range.

> "These attacks don't require any user interaction or any authentication," said Armis head researcher Ben Seri in their presentation.

## Argy-bargy Argies barge into Starbucks Wi-Fi with alt-coin discharges

-  Starbucks has joined the long growing list of organizations that have inadvertently and silently mined alt-coins on customers' computers for mystery miscreants.

- A sharp-eyed quaffer in a branch of the frothy-coffee-flavored-milk franchise noticed that when he signed on to the cafe's free Wi-Fi service something was amiss.

- Sitting in the shop in the bustling capital city of Argentina, Buenos Aires, this month, startup boss Noah Dinkin spotted that there was a ten-second delay in connecting to the internet via the Wi-Fi, and that time was used to fire up a copy of Coin Hive's Monero-mining JavaScript in his browser.

- Thus, when Dinkin and his fellow latte slurpers joined the cafe's wireless, something on the network was maliciously injecting Coin Hive's code into their web browsers so that for at least ten seconds or so, their PCs and other devices would toil away crafting Monero coins for whoever was masterminding the scam.

- Hi @Starbucks @StarbucksAr did you know that your in-store wifi provider in Buenos Aires forces a 10 second delay when you first connect to the wifi so it can mine bitcoin using a customer's laptop?

- Feels a little off-brand.. cc @GMFlickinger pic.twitter.com/VkVVdSfUtT  Noah Dinkin (@imnoah) December 2, 2017 Coin Hive's software is freely available, and when run in a webpage uses the visiting computer's spare CPU cycles to mine the digital currency Monero  which is a young alt-coin and easily crafted by laptops and handhelds.

- One XMR is right now worth $304.88  last time we looked last month or so, it was about $90.

- The idea was that, rather than rely on ad clicks and views, website owners pocket revenue by running coin-mining code in visitors' web browsers: the extracted digital money being funneled back to webmasters via Coin Hive.

## Making Tor Browser Updates Stable and Reliable with Fastly

-  Tor Browser is well-known for its tracking protection and fingerprinting resistance.

- We have spent a lot of time and energy as well to make the browser bit-by-bit reproducible in order to defend against compromises of our build machines.

- It is worth mentioning that this includes our update files, too, which are generated during the build process.

- But having reproducibly built update files, which are properly signed, is only one half of the setup we need: without being able to make them available in a timely and reliable manner our users are not as well-protected as they should be.

- Back in 2014 when we introduced the browser updater with Tor Browser 4.0, we hosted the update files ourselves.

- But it soon became obvious that it would be a challenge to scale our infrastructure to keep up with the user demand and ever growing update sizes (just compare the 50 MB we had on Linux for full updates in 2014 to the 85 MB we have today).

- Gladly, Fastly stepped up in 2016 to guarantee smooth updates for Tor Browser users.

- After some experiments, updates were provided over Fastly's infrastructure from June 2016 on.

- The first site is an emporium that sells a little of everything but mostly drugs but in their forgeries and counterfeit section I came across some goodies in their internal search engine.

- Primarily what I am going to bring you today kids is how you too can buy forged documents in the darknet to start a new life somewhere in the world.

- Watch now as I unfold to you this tale of tradecraft and OPSEC....

- PSA: Ok ok, yeah buying this stuff in the darknet is likely to have one of three outcomes.. 1) You pay and you get nothing.

- 2) You pay and you get arrested when you pick up the package.

- 3) You pay, you get the package, and then are arrested trying to use the documents.

- SO DONT TRY THIS AT HOME KIDS!

## Leaked Mormon Church booklet for leaders claims masturbation turns you gay

-     Remember when the fear of going blind or growing hair on your palms was enough to make you stop masturbating?

- Neither do I, but apparently The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been spreading a much more terrifying myth since the eighties that self pleasure makes you gay.

- A recently leaked booklet on homosexuality (second edition) for church leaders suggests early masturbation could cause adolescents to become gay, according to Newsweek.

- Early masturbation experiences introduce the individual to sexual thoughts which may become habit forming and reinforcing to homosexual interests, according to the booklet.

- Other absurd declarations about homosexuality included moms coddling their sons could turn them gay, and that it may involve violent or criminal behavior.  The church has since shifted a bit by allowing people with same sex attraction to at least be able to participate in the church, but homosexual acts violate Mormon law, according to its website.

- Masturbation also still seems out of the question.

## Intel to slap hardware lock on Management Engine code to thwart downgrade attacks

-  Intel's Coffee Lake and Cannon Lake x86 processors can be fortified by computer manufacturers to prevent in hardware attempts to downgrade, exploit and potentially neuter Chipzilla's built-in creepy Management Engine.

- In June, Positive Technologies security researchers Mark Ermolov and Maxim Goryachy privately reported to Intel a brace of exploitable bugs  CVE-2017-5705, 5706, and 5707  in the powerful Management Engine's firmware.

- Last month, in response and ahead of Ermolov and Goryachy's public presentation of their research at Black Hat Europe, Chipzilla published eight vulnerability notices: the tech giant admitted its Management Engine (ME), Server Platform Services (SPS), and Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) could be attacked to give miscreants access to the controversial hidden administrative layer  effectively granting God-mode on the computer.

- As such patches to kill off the security holes in the code are gradually being made available to organizations and people to download and install.

- Unfortunately, though, the ME's reliance on writeable firmware has meant any fixes can be reversed.

- Thus, it is possible for miscreants to reprogram flash chips on the motherboard to undo any changes.

- It's pretty much game over if you can gain enough physical access to a machine to rewrite its solid-state storage, of course.

- However, it may be possible for Intel to thwart tools  such as me_cleaner  that forcibly neuter the Management Engine in later revisions of its firmware.

- Tom Brenner/The New York Times    WASHINGTON  The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to dismantle rules regulating the businesses that connect consumers to the internet, granting broadband companies the power to potentially reshape Americans online experiences.The agency scrapped the so-called net neutrality regulations that prohibited broadband providers from blocking websites or charging for higher-quality service or certain content.

- The federal government will also no longer regulate high-speed internet delivery as if it were a utility, like phone service.The action reversed the agencys 2015 decision, during the Obama administration, to have stronger oversight over broadband providers as Americans have migrated to the internet for most communications.

## Bitcoin Drops to $13k in Red Day for Crypto Markets

-  A case of crypto traders locking in holiday gains?

- Whatever the reason, the price of bitcoin spent much of Saturday in decline, as the world's largest cryptocurrency saw a nine percent drop over the 24-hour span.

- Sunday's session has so far seen that drop intensify, with the price down nearly 12 percent as of 4:00 UTC.

- Just hours away from a launch on a major futures exchange, bitcoin is now down nearly 25 percent from an all-time high of $17,117 set earlier this week, with the price hitting a low of $13,152 today, data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index reveals.

- That said, bitcoin wasn't the only cryptocurrency affected.

- According to data from CoinMarketCap, all but one of the top 50 assets by market capitalization have seen 24-hour declines.

- At time of publication, the total value of all publicly traded cryptocurrencies was down 8 percent from its recent highs, falling from a high near $400 billion to $367 billion.

- Still, that's not to say there hasn't been periods of upward movements.

## Comcast is injecting 400+ lines of JavaScript into web pages - httpbit.ly2BqXSws

- Comcast began injecting 400+ lines of JavaScript code in to pages I requested on the internet so that when the browser renders the web page, the JavaScript generates a pop up trying to up-sell me a new modem.

- When you call the number in the popup, they're quick to tell you that you need a new modem, which in my case is not true.

- I later verified with level-2 support that my modem is pefectly fine and I don't need to upgrade.

- As deceptive as that is however, my major complaint is that Comcast is intercepting web pages and then altering them by filling them with hundreds of lines of code.

- Even worse is that I've had to speak to 7 different supervisors from all areas of Comcast and they have either never heard of the process, or those who were aware of the practice don't know how to turn it off.

- Comcast has my phone office number, my cell for texts, my email, and my home address, yet they choose to molest my requested web pages by injecting hundreds of lines of code.

- This is not like targeted advertisements when I visit websites with ads (which is perfectly acceptable), this instead is a direct manipulation of the original source code of the website.

## Mastermind behind sophisticated, massive botnet outs himself

-    EnlargeInvestigative Committee of Belarus  The mastermind behind some of the world's biggest and longest-running botnets has been jailed and his vast criminal infrastructure taken down, in part because of a careless operational security blunder that allowed authorities to identify his anonymous online persona.

- Officials from the Republic of Belarus reported Monday they detained a participant in the sprawling Andromeda botnet network, which was made up of 464 separate botnets that spread more than 80 distinct malware families since 2011.

- On Tuesday, researchers with security firm Recorded Future published a blog post that said the participant was a 33-year-old Belarusian named Sergey Jarets.

- To most people, Jarets was known only as "Ar3s," the moniker assigned to a highly respected elder in the criminal underground.

- In online discussions, Ar3s demonstrated expertise in malware development and the reverse-engineering of software.

- He also acted as a reputable guarantor of deals that were hashed out online.

- As it turned out, the ICQ number of the figure he used as one of his primary contact methods was registered in several whitehat discussion forums to one Sergey Jaretz.

- Recorded Future researchers said they eventually tracked the figure down to Jarets, who worked at OJSC "Televid" Tele-Radio Company, which broadcast throughout the Rechitsa area in the Gomel Region of Belarus.

## Top-selling handgun safe can be remotely opened in secondsno PIN needed

-    EnlargeTwo Sixes Labs  One of Amazon's top-selling electronic gun safes contains a critical vulnerability that allows it to be opened by virtually anyone, even when they don't know the password.

- The Vaultek VT20i handgun safe, ranked fourth in Amazon's gun safes and cabinets category, allows owners to electronically open the door using a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone app.

- The remote unlock feature is supposed to work only when someone knows the four- to eight-digit personal identification number used to lock the device.

- But it turns out that this PIN safeguard can be bypassed using a standard computer and a small amount of programming know-how.

- As the video demonstration below shows, researchers with security firm Two Six Labs were able to open a VT20i safe in a matter of seconds by using their MacBook Pro to send specially designed Bluetooth data while it was in range.

- The feat required no knowledge of the unlock PIN or any advanced scanning of the vulnerable safe.

- The hack works reliably even when the PIN is changed.

- All that's required to make it work is that the safe have Bluetooth connectivity turned on.

## OK, OK, MIRA-I DID IT Botnet-building compsci kid comes clean httpbit.ly2CGbod1

-  A former New Jersey college student has copped to helping create and run the massive Mirai DDoS botnet.

- Paras Jha, 21, pleaded guilty this month in an Alaska district court to two counts [PDF, PDF] of conspiracy to commit "fraud and related activity in connection with computers."

- In plea deals with US prosecutors, unsealed today, Jha admitted to being one of three people who created and ran the massive Mirai army of hacked gadgets as a DDoS-for-hire operation and as a click-fraud racket.

- Each of the charges carries up to five years behind bars, and Jha will also surrender the 13 Bitcoin (currently worth around $214,000) that he made from running the botnet and renting out its services.

- The two other men are: Josiah White, 20, of Washington, Pennsylvania, and Dalton Norman, 21, of Metairie, Louisiana.

- These two also pleaded guilty to playing a role in masterminding Mirai; Dalton additionally admitted helping Jha commit ad-click fraud.

- Jha admitted that, beginning in 2016, he, White and Norman began to assemble the Mirai botnet  a substantial army of hijacked Internet-of-Things devices, such as security webcams  that the trio could command at will.

- Using the names "Anna Senpai" and "ogmemes," Jha operated Mirai as both a DDoS cannon that could be rented to attack companies and networks  blowing websites and servers offline  and later as a click-fraud operation that directed the malware-infected gizmos to blindly and automatically click on links in order to generate affiliate advertising money.

## Google Sheds Light on Data Encryption Practices

- Google explains the details of how it secures information in the cloud and encrypts data in transit.Following a year of major cyberattacks and security threats, Google has published two whitepapers to explain how it secures data.

- One focuses on encryption of data in transit; the other on service-to-service communication using Application Layer Transport Security (ALTS).

- Google gets a lot of questions from customers on how it protects data, says Maya Kaczorowski, Google Cloud security and privacy product manager.

- Today's release details the steps taken to protect authenticity, integrity, and privacy by verifying data sources, ensuring data arrives unchanged, and keeping data confidential while in transit.

- Encryption in transit refers to "how data moves from a user to Google, and how it moves within Google's infrastructure," she explains.

- When a user sends data to the Google Cloud, it's encrypted in transit by default using HTTPS and TLS.

- Both of these are common practice; Google introduces more security for data traveling outside its infrastructure.

- Google Cloud encrypts and authenticates all data in transit, at multiple network layers, when it moves outside physical boundaries not under Google's control.

- Mozilla issued a critical security update to its popular open-source Thunderbird email client.

- The patch was part of a December release of five fixes that included two bugs rated high and one rated moderate and another low.

- Mozilla said Thunderbird, which is also serves as a news, RSS and chat client, the latest Thunderbird 52.5.2 version released last week fixes the vulnerabilities.Related Posts   Vendors Share Patch Updates on Spectre and Meltdown Mitigation Efforts   January 4, 2018 , 1:01 pm     TeamViewer Rushes Fix for Permissions Bug   December 5, 2017 , 4:04 pm     US-CERT Warns of ASLR Implementation Flaw In Windows   November 20, 2017 , 5:30 pm    The most serious of the fixes is a critical buffer overflow bug (CVE-2017-7845) impacting Thunderbird running on the Windows operating system.

- The bug is present when drawing and validating elements with angle library using Direct 3D 9, according to the Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory.

- A buffer overflow occurs when drawing and validating elements using Direct 3D 9 with the ANGLE graphics library, used for WebGL content.

- This is due to an incorrect value being passed within the library during checks and results in a potentially exploitable crash, Mozilla wrote.

- The same critical vulnerability (CVE-2017-7845) was reported and patched earlier this month in Mozillas Firefox web browser.

- That issue was resolved in Firefox 57.0.2, released on December 7.

## Apache vs Nginx: Practical Considerations (2015)

-   Introduction Apache and Nginx are the two most common open source web servers in the world.

- Together, they are responsible for serving over 50% of traffic on the internet.

- Both solutions are capable of handling diverse workloads and working with other software to provide a complete web stack.

- While Apache and Nginx share many qualities, they should not be thought of as entirely interchangeable.

- Each excels in its own way and it is important to understand the situations where you may need to reevaluate your web server of choice.

- This article will be devoted to a discussion of how each server stacks up in various areas.

- General Overview Before we dive into the differences between Apache and Nginx, let's take a quick look at the background of these two projects and their general characteristics.

- Apache The Apache HTTP Server was created by Robert McCool in 1995 and has been developed under the direction of the Apache Software Foundation since 1999.

- This post is not about those positive changes.

- This post is about people and organisations which havent changed, such as the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), who have attempted to save face in public, while privately working to undermine positive change and enable rapists.

- In June 2016, I and others spoke up about serial rapist and abuser, Jacob Appelbaum.

- Unlike other organisations  such as The Tor Project, or The Cult of the Dead Cow  the CCC delayed for more than a month in responding.

- Eventually, their hand was forced by a parody @chaosupdales Twitter account announcing that the CCC had expelled Jake.

- First, the CCC clarified that they had not expelled Jake.

- Then, the CCC posted a vague statement that all are welcome.

## Big data meets Big Brother as China moves to rate its citizens

-  On June 14, 2014, the State Council of China published an ominous-sounding document called "Planning Outline for the Construction of a Social Credit System".

- In the way of Chinese policy documents, it was a lengthy and rather dry affair, but it contained a radical idea.

- What if there was a national trust score that rated the kind of citizen you were?Imagine a world where many of your daily activities were constantly monitored and evaluated: what you buy at the shops and online; where you are at any given time; who your friends are and how you interact with them; how many hours you spend watching content or playing video games; and what bills and taxes you pay (or not).

- It's not hard to picture, because most of that already happens, thanks to all those data-collecting behemoths like Google, Facebook and Instagram or health-tracking apps such as Fitbit.

- But now imagine a system where all these behaviours are rated as either positive or negative and distilled into a single number, according to rules set by the government.

- That would create your Citizen Score and it would tell everyone whether or not you were trustworthy.

- Plus, your rating would be publicly ranked against that of the entire population and used to determine your eligibility for a mortgage or a job, where your children can go to school - or even just your chances of getting a date.A futuristic vision of Big Brother out of control?

- No, it's already getting underway in China, where the government is developing the Social Credit System (SCS) to rate the trustworthiness of its 1.3 billion citizens.

## We Made Big Improvements to Searching for Relays

- Relay Search, formerly known as Atlas, is a web application to learn about currently running Tor relays and bridges.

- You can search by fingerprint, nickname, country, flags, and contact information and be returned information about advertised bandwidth, uptime, exit policies, and more.

- What's New The biggest change has been the introduction of a new search type: aggregated search.

- The aggregated functionality is based on the functionality that Compass provided.

- Tor Metrics plans to shut down Compass at the end of the year.

- The Relay Search implementation allows for aggregate searches using the existing search syntax and allows drilling down to further aggregate by other properties, or to display the individual relays in a particular group.

- The aggregated search results are shown in a table by default but it is also possible to view country-based aggregations in a map view with countries highlighted based on consensus weight, guard/middle/exit probabilities or advertised bandwidth.

- Relay Search shows a number of relays that have been named in honor of Dmitry Bogatov, a software developer under house arrest in Russia for running a Tor exit relay The "Advanced Search" form will let you explore all the different search parameters that Relay Search offers for both individual relays and for the new aggregated queries.

- The identity of the collator isn't known but the miscreant left Bitcoin and Dogecoin wallet details for donations.

> "None of the passwords are encrypted, and whats scary is that weve tested a subset of these passwords and most of the have been verified to be true," said Julio Casal, founder of @4iQ.

> "The breach is almost two times larger than the previous largest credential exposure, the Exploit.in combo list that exposed 797 million records."

- The Exploit.in list is included in this dump, as are records reported stolen before, but a lot of this data is new.

- It has even all been indexed for easy searching and search tools are also included in the archive.

- Disturbingly the archive also shows that years of advice on choosing strong passwords is still being ignored.

## Braking news: Nissan Canada hacked, up to 1.1m Canucks exposed

-  Nissan Canada's vehicle-financing wing has been hacked, putting personal information on as many as 1.13 million customers in the hands of miscreants.

- In an email to Nissan car buyers, seen by The Register, the biz admitted its computer systems were compromised, with "unauthorized person(s) gaining access to the personal information of some customers that have financed their vehicles through Nissan Canada Finance or Infiniti Financial Services Canada."

> "We apologize for any frustration and anxiety this may cause our customers, and we thank you for your patience and support as we work through this issue," the note added.

- A similar message is now on the automaker's website.

- According to Nissan Canada, the exposed data includes at least customer names, addresses, vehicle makes and models, vehicle identification numbers (VINs), credit scores, loan amounts and monthly payment figures.

> "We are still investigating precisely what personal information has been impacted," the biz said, adding that it was working with the cops and infosec experts to work out what the heck happened.

> "At this time, there is no indication that customers who financed vehicles outside of Canada are affected."

- Nissan Canada admitted it discovered on Monday, December 11, that it had been hacked, and alerted the world, er, 10 days later.

## XenServer 7.3: Changes to the Free Edition

-  Today we're pleased to announce the release of XenServer 7.3, a raft of new features and improvements.

- Whilst you can read all about exactly what's in that release over on the release announcement blog, I wanted to provide clarity on the changes we're making to the Free Edition of XenServer as part of the release.

- As many of you will be aware, XenServer is available in three editions: Free, Standard, and Enterprise.

- All of them are installed from the same ISO, and all are equally open source.

- The Standard edition almost identical to the Free edition in terms of feature set, but includes commercial support and an extended period of hotfix availability from Citrix, whilst the Enterprise edition enables a variety of additional features.

- Having carefully considered what features are in each edition, we've taken the decision to move some features out of the Free edition, and into Standard.

- The full list of features being moved is:  Dynamic Memory Control Xen Storage Motion Active Directory Integration Role Based Access Control High Availability GPU Pass-Through Site Recovery Manager (Disaster Recovery) XenCenter Rolling Pool Upgrade Wizard Maximum Pool Size Restricted To 3 Hosts (existing larger pools will continue to work, but no new host joins will be permitted)  This will therefore make the Standard edition substantially different to the Free edition.

- No features are moving from Free to Enterprise.

-  Dell EMC has patched an SMBv1 bug in its Data Domain Deduplication and Data Protection software.

- It's probably worth your time running the patch in, if you can, because as the advisory explained, it's a memory overflow that could open a system to remote code execution (RCE).

- CVE-2017-14385 affects quite a few versions of the system: the Data Domain DD OS 5.7 family prior to 5.7.5.6; 6.0 versions prior to 6.0.2.9; 6.1 versions prior to 6.1.0.21; all versions of Data Domain Virtual Edition in 2.0, 3.0 prior to 3.0 SP2 Update 1, and 3.1 prior to 3.1 Update 2.

- In its notice, Cisco expanded on the bug's impact: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SMBv1 packets to a targeted system.

- A successful exploit could trigger a memory overflow condition that the attacker could leverage to execute arbitrary code on the system.

- In addition, the attacker could also leverage this vulnerability to shut down the SMB service and Active Directory authentication, resulting in a DoS condition. If you can't patch immediately, external traffic to the system can be blocked at the firewall.

- Patches are available to registered users here.

## New Thunderbird Releases and New Thunderbird Staff

-     Thunderbird is going strong at version 52 (ESR) and 57, 58 beta In April 2017 Thunderbird released its successful Extended Service Release (ESR) version 52.

- This release has just seen its fifth dot update 52.5.0, where fixes, stability and minor functionality improvements were shipped.

- Thunder 57 Photon Visual Refresh Thunderbird 57 beta was also very successful.

- While Thunderbird 58 is equally stable and offers further cutting-edge improvements to Thunderbird users, the user community is starting to feel the impact of Mozilla platform changes which are phasing out so-called legacy add-ons.

- The Thunderbird technical leadership is working closely with add-on authors who face the challenge of updating their add-ons to work with the Mozilla interface changes.

- With a few usually simple changes most add-ons can be made to work in Thunderbird 58 beta.

- https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/Add-ons_Guide_57 explains what needs to be done, and Thunderbird developers are happy to lend a hand to add-on authors.

- There has been some discussion about the modernisation of Thunderbirds user interface.

## This dominatrix makes men mine cryptocurrency for her  she now has over $1m

-  As bitcoin climbs to record values, many people are wishing they had invested in the currency sooner  while dozens of men who did buy it are giving it to a woman theyve never met.

- The woman, who calls herself Theodora, is a financial dominatrix, which means clients  many of whom never meet her in person  derive sexual pleasure from giving her gifts and money.

- Exchanges of money can range from several dollars in tributes, as they are called, to gifts of more than six figures.

- Some clients even become a human ATM, meaning they give her complete control over a bank account.

- Its a form of psychological domination where money is the tool for the transfer of power, Theodora said.

- Its quite common for powerful men like politicians or CEOs to look for a form of sexual release by submitting to a woman  they are in control all the time during the day  and giving up control financially is a more tangible instrument of power for them.  A lot of geek clients were really excited when I taught them how to build a mining rig for me so they could mine 24/7 from their home.      Based in Paris, Theodora has been working as a dominatrix for eight years and accepting cryptocurrency for four.

- She also specializes in femdom hypnosis, a process through which she says shes able to dominate men using hypnotism.

- Her clients, all men, are in their late 30s to early 50s and usually come from the U.S. and the U.K., she said.

## US capital's surveillance cam network allegedly hijacked by Romanian ransomware suspects

-  Two of the five unnamed individuals cuffed this month in Romania on suspicion of spreading ransomware face US computer crime charges  for their alleged role in taking over 123 out of 187 networked computers that control Washington DC's CCTV cameras earlier this year.

- According to Europol, which led the arrests, this week, two of those arrested are suspected of attacking American computer systems using the Cerber ransomware.

- The Euro plod noted that the US Secret Service is also investigating those malware infections.

- In an affidavit obtained by CNN  unsealed by mistake and then resealed  Secret Service agent James Graham laid out the basis for the US Department of Justice's computer fraud case against two Romanian nationals, Mihai Alexandru Isvanca and Eveline Cismaru.

- In an email to The Register, a justice department spokesperson confirmed the linkage of the arrests and the US court filing.

> "These are separate but related investigations and the people you name are among those arrested by Europol," the spokesperson said.

> "Any court documents are not publicly available."

- In other words, the Isvanca and Cismaru nabbed in Romania by police as suspected Cerber ransomware extortionists are the Isvanca and Cismaru accused in the US of attacking the American capital's CCTV camera system.

## 'Starwars' Debuts on List of Worst Passwords of 2017 httpubm.io2oQDa3x

- Many of the old standbys made this year's list of the 25 stolen - and weakest - passwords found dumped online.Once again, the top two worst and most popular passwords of the year were "123456" and "Password."

- But one of the newest most commonly found compromised passwords this year was "starwars" at #16.

- The 2017 Worst Passwords list, drawn from more than five million stolen and passwords found online and in plain text by researchers at password management firm SplashData, represents mostly credentials from users in North America and Western Europe.

- The list, now in its seventh year, doesn't include credentials exposed in the Yahoo breach, nor from compromised adult websites.

> "Starwars," an apparent homage to the wildly popular Star Wars movie franchise, actually beat out the infamous "passw0rd," which came in at #17.

- Morgan Slain, CEO of SplashData, says his firm basically scrapes Pastebin and other online lists for exposed passwords.

> "We don't buy or decrypt any lists" of stolen credentials," he says.

- Some of the other usual suspects hit the top ten once again, including "12345678," "qwerty," and "football," and newcomers to the top spots include the slightly longer yet still uncreative "123456789" (#6), "letmein" (#7), and "iloveyou" (#10).

## Tax-Free Bitcoin-To-Ether Trading in US to End Under GOP Plan

-  Investors in bitcoin and other virtual currencies would lose a lucrative tax break under the Republican tax bill thats on its way to President Donald Trumps desk.New limits in the bill would bar cryptocurrency owners from deferring capital gains taxes when trading one type of virtual currency for another -- effectively closing a gray area in the tax code, experts say.Those gains can be considerable.

- Bitcoin, which had an initial price of less than 1 cent when it first traded in 2010, was around $1,000 as 2017 began and surpassed $19,000 this week, at least briefly, before paring some of the gains.

- Many enthusiasts jump between bitcoin and a long list of similarly volatile competitors, such as ether.

- For investors who hold the virtual currencies, the bill is bad news, said Kelsey Lemaster, a tax attorney with Goodwin Procter LLP.

- Every time you trade one digital currency for another, one token for another, its going to be a taxable event.The change might not deter traders, who have been leaping into cryptocurrencies without researching what they are -- let alone their tax implications, said Brian Kristiansen, a partner in the digital currency services practice at Friedman LLP.Bitcoin Whales Are Cutting Back as Eager Minnows Dive In: GadflyUnder current law, such trades have been protected under a provision that allows investors to defer capital gains taxes on so-called like-kind exchanges -- trades that traditionally have been staples for investors in real estate, art, racehorses and aircraft.

- The deferral applies when owners of such property swap it for other property of a similar kind, typically within a 180-day period.Unreal PropertyIncreasingly, traders concerned about increased government oversight have sought to move between virtual currencies to take advantage of the like-kind deferral.

- Now, though, the GOP tax bill would restrict the break to trades of domestic real estate only.

- Thats only for real property now, and crypto is about as not real as you can get, said Friedmans Kristiansen.That change goes into effect on Jan. 1.

## Ongoing DDoS on the Tor Network: Status

-  David Goulet dgoulet at torproject.org  Wed Dec 20 16:15:39 UTC 2017  Previous message (by thread): [tor-project] Tor Browser team meeting notes, 18 Dec 2017  Next message (by thread): [tor-project] Notes from December 21 2017 Vegas team meeting   Messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ]   Greetings, Earlier this month, many relay operators started noticing huge loads on their relays both in terms of traffic and memory consumption leading to relays malfunctionning or even dying in some cases.

- We've started looking at this in depth in the last few days.

- It turns out that many relays (not all) are under a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack which makes them use a lot of memory ultimately making the operating system stop the process or becoming unreliable because of the resource pressure.

- This has lead to some relays to restart, being shutdown or becoming so unstable that they would fall in and out of the network.

- You can see here on the Metrics portal the consequences of this ongoing attack: https://metrics.torproject.org/relayflags.html?start=2017-09-20=2017-12-20=Running=Exit=Fast=Guard=Stable=HSDir Among other things, it is badly affecting relays with the HSDir flag because once they restart, it takes 96 hours before they get the flag back.

- This affects the reachability of hidden services and thus the UX of .onions.

- We've been analyzing some relays being flooded to understand what is going on and how to fix it.

- The good news is that we are fairly confident that we know what is happening and we are currently testing some fixes to address the situation.

## Flaw Found In Dirty COW Patch

- A flaw in the original patch for the notorious Dirty COW vulnerability could allow an adversary to run local code on affected systems and exploit a race condition to perform a privilege escalation attack.

- The flaw in the Dirty COW patch (CVE-2016-5195), released in October 2016, was identified by researchers at the security firm Bindecy.

- On Wednesday, they released details of the vulnerability (CVE-2017-1000405) found in the original Dirty COW patch, affecting several Linux distributions.Related Posts   Juniper Issues Security Alert Tied to Routers and Switches   August 10, 2017 , 1:56 pm     Linux Systemd Bug Could Have Led to Crash, Code Execution   June 29, 2017 , 1:59 pm     Patches Available for Linux Sudo Vulnerability   May 31, 2017 , 1:55 pm    The scope of affected products is significantly smaller than the original Dirty COW bug, which impacted many more Linux distributions and the Android operating system.

- In terms of scope, the difference is just that the current bug is not applicable to Android and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

- All other distributions  Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE  suffer from the issue.

- So, the scope is still large.

- We estimate that millions of machines are vulnerable, said Daniel Shapiro, researcher at Bindecy, credited for finding the flaw along with colleague Eylon Ben Yaakov.

- The vulnerability, CVE-2017-1000405, is rated Important and scores 6.1 on the CVSS scale.

## Nvidia to cease producing new drivers for 32-bit systems

-    Enlarge / You wouldn't really want to use Nvidia's $3,000 Titan V with a 32-bit operating system anyway.Nvidia  While most people have probably made the switch by now, yet another reason to drop 32-bit operating systems and move to 64-bits is coming.

- Version 390 of Nvidia's graphics drivers, likely to arrive in January, will be the last to contain support for 32-bit versions of Windows (7, 8/8.1, and 10), Linux, and FreeBSD.

- There will be another year of security updates for 32-bit drivers, but all new features, performance enhancements, and support for new hardware will require the use of a 64-bit operating system and 64-bit drivers.

- Reasons to stick with 32-bit Windows are at this point few and far between.

- 64-bit Windows has superior security to 32-bit, and while it varies with workload, 64-bit applications can run somewhat faster than 32-bit counterparts; for workloads that won't fit within the constraints of 32-bit software, the difference is of course enormous.

- Generally, those who continue to use the 32-bit operating system tend to be subject to some kind of legacy constraint.

- 32-bit drivers won't work in 64-bit Windows, so obscure but mission critical hardware can extend the life of 32-bit systems.

- There can be software issues, too: 32-bit Windows can run both 16-bit Windows and 16- and 32-bit DOS applications.

- It supports registering, verifying, sending and receiving messages.

- To be able to link to an existing Signal-Android/signal-cli instance, signal-cli uses a patched libsignal-service-java, because libsignal-service-java does not yet support provisioning as a slave device.

- For registering you need a phone number where you can receive SMS or incoming calls.

- signal-cli is primarily intended to be used on servers to notify admins of important events.

- For this use-case, it has a dbus interface, that can be used to send messages from any programming language that has dbus bindings.

- Installation You can yourself, or use the provided binary files, which should work on Linux, macOS and Windows.

- For Arch Linux there is also a package in AUR.

## Edward Snowdens New App Uses Your Smartphone to Physically Guard Your Laptop httpbit.ly2DznqW7

- Like many other journalists, activists, and software developers I know, I carry my laptop everywhere while Im traveling.

- It contains sensitive information; messaging app conversations, email, password databases, encryption keys, unreleased work, web browsers logged into various accounts, and so on.

- My disk is encrypted, but all it takes to bypass this protection is for an attacker  a malicious hotel housekeeper, or evil maid, for example  to spend a few minutes physically tampering with it without my knowledge.

- If I come back and continue to use my compromised computer, the attacker could gain access to everything.

- Edward Snowden and his friends have a solution.

- The NSA whistleblower and a team of collaborators have been working on a new open source Android app called Haven that you install on a spare smartphone, turning the device into a sort of sentry to watch over your laptop.

- Haven uses the smartphones many sensors  microphone, motion detector, light detector, and cameras  to monitor the room for changes, and it logs everything it notices.

- The first public beta version of Haven has officially been released; its available in the Play Store and on F-Droid, an open source app store for Android.

## Attack Attribution Tricky Say Some as US Blames North Korea for WannaCry

- There's not enough evidence to conclusively tie the rogue regime to the ransomware attacks, some security experts say.The US government's assertion this week that North Korea is behind the WannaCry ransomware attacks of earlier this year has surfaced familiar concerns about the tricky nature of attack attribution in cyberspace.

- Some security industry experts believe there's not enough evidence - at least not enough that's publicly available - to definitively tie the government in North Korea to the attacks.

- They believe that most of the clues that have been cited as evidence of North Korea's involvement in an attack that ravaged some 300,000 computers worldwide, is circumstantial and can have other explanations.

> "The evidence is weak," says Ross Rustici, senior director of intelligence services at Boston-based cybersecurity firm Cybereason.

> "Without the initial source or any way to tie the code to an actual person we cannot do real attribution."

- The Trump Administration's homeland security advisor Thomas Bossert on Monday identified North Korea as being directly responsible for the WannaCry attack, which infected computers in 150 countries.

- In an opinion column for the Wall Street Journal, Bossert said the US government has evidence that shows a direct link between Pyongyang and the attacks.

- He did not reveal what additional information the government might have obtained - other than what is already publicly known - to arrive at the conclusion.

## I Got Paid $0 from the Uber Security Bug Bounty

- So Uber partners with HackerOne to offer a public bug bounty program, advertising a $500 minimum guaranteed payout if a security vulnerability is found within an Uber app or information asset.

- Fair enough, Ive led numerous penetration tests over the years in addition to delivering advanced pentest training for corporate clients.I spend a few days getting some resources lined up for the analysis piece, and build a fairly comprehensive map of Ubers various endpoints using subdomain enumeration and application fingerprinting.

- I also start kicking the tires of Ubers Android app, which is locked down pretty tight per the Uber Bug Bounty Treasure Map with certificate-pinned HTTPS requests.

- After a few hours of wrangling with the Android SDK, I get the most recent Uber .apk running in an ARM emulator as they apparently dont publish any x86 Android apps.

- Slooooooow progress to say the least.I manage to bypass some of the certificate pinning security in the Uber .apk, sufficient to start mapping out some of the Uber mobile endpoints.

- There is reference in that traffic to a Microsoft Phone API, so I head over to the Microsoft Store and start testing the Uber Surface/Windows Phone app.It doesnt implement any type of certificate pinning, which is a violation of Ubers own publicly-stated Treasure Map; so theres the first guaranteed $500 payout per their bug bounty.Uber uses OAuth2 tokens for all of their mobile app authentication workflow, which has a lot of security benefits over old school cookie-based authentication methods.

- I put together a Python-based client that can talk to Ubers backends to start harvesting OAuth2 tokens, but whats weird is the OAuth2 token doesnt ever change, and I cant find anything in the Uber developer documentation that deals with token expiration; literally the same token I was issued when I first created my Uber account for testing is the same token I keep getting, no matter how many times I log in and out of my account using the Surface app.

- Surely Uber is expiring these tokens at least once every few days?I put that issue on the back burner and start probing the Uber promo endpoint, which has two pretty glaring vulnerabilities in that it doesnt implement any type of rate limiting for promo code POSTs nor does it require any multifactor authentication.

## Revolution and Evolution: Fully Homomorphic Encryption - Galois, Inc.

-  This article originally appeared in the Summer 2017 edition of the U.S. Cybersecurity Magazine More and more computation is being outsourced to public clouds such as Amazons GovCloud and Elastic Compute Cloud, RackSpace, and others.

- Its the new gig economy for computer hardware.

- These cloud computers can be just as vulnerable as any other computer, putting the privacy of sensitive data at risk.

- As nation-state cyber weapons become increasingly available to amateur and low-level professional cyber criminals, the external threats against those cloud-based systems continue to grow.

- In addition, clouds are controlled by vendors who have intimate access to those machines, creating an insider threat that presents an even greater risk to privacy.

- But why is privacy at risk here?

- Surely were all smart enough to encrypt our data while its on the move into and out of cloud-based systems.

- TLS, among other protocols, takes care of that for us (if we remember to use it).

## Specially prepared photos shown bypassing Windows Hello facial recognition  Ars Technica httpbit.ly2kFk5gd

-  SySS demonstrates using the printout of the IR photo to trick Windows Hello on a Surface Pro 4.

- Security researchers at a German security firm, SySS, have shown that the Windows Hello facial recognition can be tricked by using specially prepared printouts of photographs.

- Microsoft added an "enhanced anti-spoofing" mode in the Windows 10 Creators Update earlier this year that properly defeats the attack, but it's neither enabled by default nor compatible with all Windows Hello hardware.

- The obvious question with any kind of facial recognition-based biometric authentication system is, how easily can it be tricked with a photograph?

- Since it's easy to take a picture of someone's face, often without them even knowing, a facial recognition system that can be fooled by a photo isn't much use.

- The Windows Hello system has two main parts: there's the physical hardware, which for Hello is a webcam with infrared illumination and detection, and the software algorithms, which are part of Microsoft's Biometric Framework.

- With this design, Microsoft can refine and improve the algorithms, and the improvements should work for any compatible hardware.

- Windows Hello's infrared requirement should protect it from being spoofed by regular photos.

## Network Printer & Scanner Spoofing Campaign Targets Millions

- Cybercriminals distribute malicious email attachments purportedly coming from three common brands of network printer-scanner devices.Spoofed emails purportedly coming from HP, Canon, and Epson network printer-scanner devices are attempting to infect millions of users with malicious attachments, according to Barracuda.

- The attempts began in late November with the attackers sending bogus emails that read "Scanned from HP," "Scanned from Epson," or "Scanned from Canon," in the subject line, Barracuda researchers note in a blog.

- The attackers use PDF files to carry their malicious payload, because employees will typically send a PDF file from a network printer to their co-workers, Barracuda notes.

- Attackers have attempted to avoid detection by modifying file names and extensions from within the traditional file archive.

- This allows the attackers to hide the malware inside the archive and imitate a .jpg, .txt, or other file format.

- Once the attachment is opened, the attackers can gain remote access to users' computers and check for network-connected systems.

- Read more about the spoofed network printer-scanner campaign here.

- However, since we introduced it at Pwn2Own, we started receiving VMware submissions through the Zero Day Initiative program and saw two successful VMware escapes at Pwn2Own 2017.One of the best VMware submissions we received in 2017 was ZDI-17-921/CVE-2017-4934.

- The vulnerability affects the VMware NAT Service (vmnat.exe).

- Whats remarkable is that the last vulnerability found in this service dates back to 2005.

## Hundreds Rickrolled in Mysterious Campus Prank at Cornell | The Cornell Daily Sun httpbit.ly2BX8jVY

-  Did you hear that?For more than a week, students and staff in at least four campus buildings heard a five-second tune, but couldnt pinpoint exactly where it was coming from.Some ignored it.

- Others questioned if they might be imagining things after one too many all-nighters.

- Many wondered where the noises, which began around Halloween, were coming from and what was producing them.It was driving me crazy all week, said Fred Cederstrom, a student manager at Temple of Zeus in Klarman Hall.Every day, you just got madder and madder, Patty Dennison 18 said, recalling that she and others finally became accustomed to the noise that permeated the Statler Hall lounge every 30-or-so minutes.The eight-bit tune (click here to listen) is a sample of Rick Astleys Never Gonna Give You Up, and hundreds of students in at least four buildings  Statler, Duffield, Klarman and Gates halls  have been repeatedly Rickrolled for more than a week by devices they suspect were placed by a prankster or pranksters.As soon as Cederstrom recognized the song, he thought, Oh no.

- I get it now.  Cameron Pollack / Sun Photography Editor Fred Cederstrom, a student manager at Temple of Zeus, describes hearing the sound for more than a week before finding where the device was hiding.

- The phenomenon of tricking people into listening to Astleys chart-topping 1987 song has been a staple of the internet since about 2007, and a Cornell prankster seems to have now brought the trolling act into the physical world.Someone really had to commit to this joke, said Justin Parratt 18, who heard the tune in the basement of Gates Hall.

- They didnt just do this casually.A Sun reporter and Viri Garcia 20, a senior arts writer for The Sun, chronicled the frequency of the tune in Klarman Hall for about seven hours in the early morning of Nov. 3, determining that the sound played at irregular intervals  between 32 and 38 minutes apart.Using The Suns tabulations, Cederstrom found the source of the tune: a quarter-sized black disc with several wires and a watch battery.

- It was hidden in a light sill in Klarman.But shortly after that device was found and confiscated by Cederstrom, two more popped up in hidden areas in Klarman Hall.

- Garcia discovered one disc that produced Astleys song from under a statue in Klarman Hall, and another device seems to be playing the song intermittently from behind a wall in the building.

## Chrome 63 vs Windows 10 Edge: Google steps up rivalry with site isolation security

-                 Google's latest effort to pry businesses odd Internet Explorer and keep them away from Windows 10 Edge is a new security feature called site isolation, which handles each page in its own process.

- With the release of Chrome 63, enterprise admins will be able to configure Chrome to render content for each site in its own dedicated process.

- According to Google, keeping each site isolated from other sites in Chrome offers enterprises the strongest security.

- The technique is designed to thwart attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the renderer process to run malicious code inside Chrome's render sandbox and steal information.

- However, it does come with a significant overhead, bumping up Chrome's memory usage on PCs by between 10 and 20 percent.

- Chrome's optional, per-site isolation comes as Microsoft continues to harden Windows 10 Edge using hardware-based virtualization through tools such as Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG), which allow Edge to run in an isolated hardware environment.

- In October, Microsoft said that WDAG marked a major breakthrough in sandbox technology since it offers a shield against attacks on the kernel, which is unprotected if an attack escapes the browser sandbox.The good news for end-users is that Google and Microsoft are competing fiercely on the security front, adopting different approaches to protect against new attacks.With Chrome 63, businesses can also configure policies to restrict access to extensions based on the permissions required.

- Image: Google    The one-site-per-process feature has been an equally important project for Chrome.

## Summon by cyberark

-  overview summon is a command-line tool that reads a file in secrets.yml format and injects secrets as environment variables into any process.

- Once the process exits, the secrets are gone.

- summon is not tied to a particular secrets source.

- Instead, sources are implemented as providers that summon calls to fetch values for secrets.

- Providers need only satisfy a simple contract and can be written in any language.

- Running summon looks like this: summon --provider conjur -f secrets.yml chef-client --once  summon resolves the entries in secrets.yml with the conjur provider and makes the secret values available to the environment of the command chef-client --once.

- In our chef recipes we can access the secrets with Rubys ENV['...'] syntax.

- This same pattern works for any tooling that can access environment variables.

## Satori botnet rears its head, exploiting IoT vulnerabilities

-  According to security researchers, a new IoT botnet has quietly hijacked more than 100,000 routers, readying them for paralysing distributed denial-of-service attacks against websites.

- The botnet, which some researchers have dubbed Satori (a name given to supernatural mind-reading monsters in Japanese folklore), has increased its activity in recent days  propagating very quickly via a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in Huawei Home Gateway or Huaweis Echolife Home Gateway devices, and an already documented vulnerability in Realtek routers.

- The exploitation of vulnerabilities allows the botnet to infect routers even when they have been secured with strong passwords.

- Through the attack, an army of hundreds of thousands of routers are thought to have been commandeered into the botnet.

- Some commentators have even suggested that over 280,000 IP addresses have been compromised by the attack in just 12 hours.

- Like the Reaper IoT botnet before it, Satori is built on the foundations of the notorious Mirai botnet which knocked major websites offline last year, and whose source code was released onto the internet.

- Heres some sensible advice for internet users:  Ensure that you are not using default passwords on any of your IoT devices.

- Change them to strong, unique passwords instead.

## Naked rowers calendar hit by denial-of-service attack following Russia 'ban'

-  103SHARESShare on FacebookRedditBuffer    Meet some of the fine upstanding young men from the University of Warwick's rowing club, who raise money for charity each year by posing for a nude calendar.

- Apparently Warwick Rowers' merchandise - with its claimed message of defiance against homophobia in sport - has been reached far beyond the shores of the UK, being purchased in around 80 countries around the world each year - raising funds for charity Sport Allies.

- As the Warwick Rowers website explains: "It began because rowing is a really expensive sport, and we don't get as much help with our costs as rowing clubs at other, longer established universities, who may have large alumni bequests to fund sports activity.

- Now, the calendar means so much more to us than just a way to fund our sport.

- It is our way of getting a message out there that we hope makes a contribution to advancement of LGBT rights and gender equality."

- So far, nothing much to get very flustered about.

- Although that you may be worried that the boys would catch a dreadful chill if they got up to some of these antics in their home town, giving the typical weather in the Midlands.

- But they have had an unexpected problem this year, in the form of Russia.

## NSA "Red Disk" Data Leak

-  NSA "Red Disk" Data Leak ZDNet is reporting about another data leak, this one from US Army's Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), which is also within the NSA.

- The disk image, when unpacked and loaded, is a snapshot of a hard drive dating back to May 2013 from a Linux-based server that forms part of a cloud-based intelligence sharing system, known as Red Disk.

- The project, developed by INSCOM's Futures Directorate, was slated to complement the Army's so-called distributed common ground system (DCGS), a legacy platform for processing and sharing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information.

- [...] Red Disk was envisioned as a highly customizable cloud system that could meet the demands of large, complex military operations.

- The hope was that Red Disk could provide a consistent picture from the Pentagon to deployed soldiers in the Afghan battlefield, including satellite images and video feeds from drones trained on terrorists and enemy fighters, according to a Foreign Policy report.

- [...] Red Disk was a modular, customizable, and scalable system for sharing intelligence across the battlefield, like electronic intercepts, drone footage and satellite imagery, and classified reports, for troops to access with laptops and tablets on the battlefield.

- Marking files found in several directories imply the disk is "top secret," and restricted from being shared to foreign intelligence partners.

- A couple of points.

## "Crypto" Is Being Redefined as Cryptocurrencies

-  "Crypto" Is Being Redefined as Cryptocurrencies I agree with Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, "Cryptocurrencies aren't 'crypto'": Lately on the internet, people in the world of Bitcoin and other digital currencies are starting to use the word "crypto" as a catch-all term for the lightly regulated and burgeoning world of digital currencies in general, or for the word "cryptocurrency" -- which probably shouldn't even be called "currency," by the way.

- [...] To be clear, I'm not the only one who is mad about this.

- Bitcoin and other technologies indeed do use cryptography: all cryptocurrency transactions are secured by a "public key" known to all and a "private key" known only to one party -- this is the basis for a swath of cryptographic approaches (known as public key, or asymmetric cryptography) like PGP.

- But cryptographers say that's not really their defining trait.

> "Most cryptocurrency barely has anything to do with serious cryptography," Matthew Green, a renowned computer scientist who studies cryptography, told me via email.

> "Aside from the trivial use of digital signatures and hash functions, it's a stupid name."

- It is a stupid name.

## 2017 Security Predictions through the Rear Window

-  If you're going to forecast the future, go big.

- It's no secret that I've long held a dim view of the security predictions that invariably bombard our feeds and social media accounts every December.

- In years past, I made a point to write up an article using a list of predictions from a blog post 10 years earlier.

- The catch here was that the list read as an indictment as opposed to a prediction.

- Of the list of 10 security issues, eight remained relevant a decade after they were posted.

- The practice of making predictions often brings to mind the image of a palm reader or medium saying, "I'm seeing a security breach for a company that starts with ... A ... B?"

- This may seem a little cruel, but I can't help to draw a parallel with Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window.

- The protagonist of the film  confined to his apartment in the summer heat  pieces together a crime from the bits and pieces that he sees unfolding in the apartment across the way from his rear window.

## Acoustical Attacks against Hard Drives

-  Acoustical Attacks against Hard Drives Interesting destructive attack: "Acoustic Denial of Service Attacks on HDDs": Abstract: Among storage components, hard disk drives (HDDs) have become the most commonly-used type of non-volatile storage due to their recent technological advances, including, enhanced energy efficacy and significantly-improved areal density.

- Such advances in HDDs have made them an inevitable part of numerous computing systems, including, personal computers, closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems, medical bedside monitors, and automated teller machines (ATMs).

- Despite the widespread use of HDDs and their critical role in real-world systems, there exist only a few research studies on the security of HDDs.

- In particular, prior research studies have discussed how HDDs can potentially leak critical private information through acoustic or electromagnetic emanations.

- Borrowing theoretical principles from acoustics and mechanics, we propose a novel denial-of-service (DoS) attack against HDDs that exploits a physical phenomenon, known as acoustic resonance.

- We perform a comprehensive examination of physical characteristics of several HDDs and create acoustic signals that cause significant vibrations in HDDs internal components.

- We demonstrate that such vibrations can negatively influence the performance of HDDs embedded in real-world systems.

- We show the feasibility of the proposed attack in two real-world case studies, namely, personal computers and CCTVs.

## Code Used in Zero Day Huawei Router Attack Made Public

- Exploit code used in the Mirai malware variant called Satori, which was used to attack hundreds of thousands of Huawei routers over the past several weeks, is now public.

- Researchers warn the code will quickly become a commodity and be leveraged in DDoS attacks via botnets such as Reaper or IOTrooper.

- Ankit Anubhav, researcher at NewSky Security first identified the code on Monday that was posted publicly on Pastebin.com.

- The code is the zero-day vulnerability CVE- 2017-17215 used by a hacker identified as Nexus Zeta to spread a variant of the Mirai malware called Satori, also known as Mirai Okiru.Related Posts   Huawei Router Vulnerability Used to Spread Mirai Variant   December 22, 2017 , 6:09 pm     1M Downloads Later, Google Pulls Phony WhatsApp From Google Play   November 6, 2017 , 9:45 am     Poisoned Search Results Deliver Banking Malware   November 3, 2017 , 2:59 pm    The fact that the code is now in the open means that more threat actors would now be using it.

- We can assume that the exploit would become commodity, and IoT botnets that attempt at exploiting a large kit of vulnerabilities will be adding CVE- 2017-17215 to their arsenal, said Maya Horowitz, threat intelligence group manager, Check Point.

- Last week, Check Point identified the vulnerability (CVE-2017-17215) in a Huawei home router model HG532 that was being exploited by Nexus Zeta to spread the Mirai variant Mirai Okiru/Satori.

- Since then Huawei issued an updated security notice to customers warning the flaw allows a remote adversary to send malicious packets to port 37215 to execute remote code on vulnerable routers.

- This code is now known to a variety of black hats.

## Escaping Docker container using waitid() - CVE-2017-5123 | Twistlock

-   Dec 27, 2017by    share:   This post describes how I exploited the waitid() vulnerability in order to modify the Linux capabilities of a Docker container to gain elevated privileges, and ultimately escape the container jail.

- But before we dive in, since an image is worth a thousand words, here is my exploit in action.

- It modifies the containerized process capabilities structure in memory, resulting in a gain of CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities.

- This results in the ability to enable promiscuous mode on eth0 ( docker bridge for the container):    Note that I have turned off Kernel ASLR for the recording, but it also works with KASLR as we can find the kernel base and the heap base by using the same vulnerability.

- CVE-2017-5123 was published earlier this year on Oct 12  it was a Linux kernel vulnerability in the waitid() syscall for 4.12-4.13 kernel versions.

- The waitid() syscall defined as : int waitid(idtype_t idtype, id_t id, siginfo_t *infop, int options); The vulnerability allows an attacker to write a partially-controlled data to kernel memory address of his choice.

- The kernel memory address can be provided as the infop pointer above.

- The pointer points to a struct siginfo described below.

## LastPass Authenticator app is not secure

- UPDATE: The issue has been fixed.

- Please see below.Ive found a really easy way to bypass the fingerprint/PIN authentication that protects all of your 2FA codes.

- The Android app, produced by LastPass, doesnt use the same protection that their flagship app uses (like locking when idle, lock on screen off, etc).All you need is access to individual activities (screens of apps).

- You dont need root to access these; pre-Oreo you can use an app like Adam Szalkowskis Activity Launcher or if youre on Oreo you can use sika524s QuickShortcutMaker.The activity you need to access is com.lastpass.authenticator.activities.SettingsActivity:The settings activityOpen the settings activity and youll see (surprise, surpise) the settings page.

- Pressing the back arrow in the top left (or your back arrow button) will bring you to the Main activity, where your 2FA codes lay.

- Notice how at no point you needed to provide your PIN/fingerprint to access this activity?This lack of protection can be automated as its merely a standard Android activity.

- Unfortunately the app is not covered under the Bugcrowd bounty programme but I feel that it is important to let people know.

- The best workaround currently is using a good App locker, such as the inbuilt locker in OxygenOS or KeepSafes App Lock.

## No hack needed: Anonymisation beaten with a dash of SQL

-  Governments should not release anonymised data that refers to individuals, because re-identification is inevitable.

- That's the conclusion from Melbourne University's Dr Chris Culnane, Dr Benjamin Rubinstein and Dr Vanessa Teague, who have shown that the Medicare data the Australian government briefly published last year can be re-identified  trivially.

- The researchers demonstrated last year that the (hopefully deprecated) formula the government used to create "anonymous" identifiers for personal data was easily reversible.

- The paper, here [PDF], examines the same data set that brought the wrath of Australia's sysadmin-in-chief, er, attorney general George Brandis, who proposed legislation (not yet passed) to criminalise unauthorised research into re-identification.

- The researchers explained that there are simply too many facts in a data release to properly protect individuals' data.

- Speaking to El Reg today, Dr Teague emphasised that from an academic point of view, nothing the trio was doing was either new or sophisticated.

- What this shows: de-identification of detailed individual records about people doesn't work, she said.

- As Dr Culnane said in the University of Melbourne's media release, We found that patients can be re-identified, without decryption, through a process of linking the unencrypted parts of the record with known information about the individual such as medical procedures and year of birth. Without decryption is also an important point: there's no hacking involved here, and as Dr Teague told us, there's not even much by way of analysis.

## Lessons Learned from the Estonian National ID Security Flaw

-  Lessons Learned from the Estonian National ID Security Flaw Estonia recently suffered a major flaw in the security of their national ID card.

- This article discusses the fix and the lessons learned from the incident: In the future, the infrastructure dependency on one digital identity platform must be decreased, the use of several alternatives must be encouraged and promoted.

- In addition, the update and replacement capacity, both remote and physical, should be increased.

- We also recommend the government to procure the readiness to act fast in force majeure situations from the eID providers..

- While deciding on the new eID platforms, the need to replace cryptographic primitives must be taken into account -- particularly the possibility of the need to replace algorithms with those that are not even in existence yet.

## California advises against keeping your phone in your pocket httpengt.co2Bkpssh

-  The jury is still out on whether or not cellphone radiation is bad for you, but California's Department of Public Health isn't taking any chances.

- The agency just issued an advisory that suggests residents should take steps to limit their exposure to cellphones.

- The notice recommends avoiding phone use when unnecessary, particularly when the cell signal is likely to kick into overdrive (such as when you're in a weak coverage area or streaming video).

- It also advises keeping your handset away from your body -- CDPH Director Dr. Karen Smith even suggests "not keeping your phone in your pocket."

- The advisory follows the release of CDPH findings from 2009, which were prompted by a lawsuit from UC Berkeley professor Joel Moskowitz in his bid to explore possible links between cellphone use and increased risks of cancer.

- He believes that cellphone radiation poses a "major risk."

- Other agencies, such as Connecticut's own Department of Public Health, have put out similar recommendations.The CTIA wireless industry group, which has historically opposed attempts to raise public concerns over phone radiation, isn't taking a definitive stance.

- In a statement, the CTIA said that health was "important" to its members and that people should "consult the experts.

## Jailed Hacker Claims Proof He Breached DNC on Russia's Orders

- A Russian national in jail for hacking the Democratic National Committee says a data signature proves he acted on the Kremlin's orders.Konstantin Kozlovsky, a jailed Russian who claims he hacked the Democratic National Committee, now says he can prove Russian intelligence ordered him to steal emails released during the 2016 US presidential election.

- Earlier this year, Kozlovsky made headlines when his confession to hacking the DNC on Russia's orders was made public.

- He was arrested on a separate charge this year, as an alleged member of a hacking group that stole more than $50 million from Russian bank accounts.

- In an interview with a Russian television station made public Dec. 27, Kozlovsky reported more details on what he said was an operation led by the Russian intelligence agency FSB to hack the DNC.

- He claims he planted a string of numbers -- his Russian passport and visa number to visit the island of St. Martin -- in a generic .dat file.

- The idea was to give himself a safety net in case those who directed the attack turned on him, he claims.

- In other details released this week, Kozlovsky said he collaborated with the FSB to create computer viruses.

- These were first tested on large Russian corporations and later used on multinational businesses, according to a published McClatchy report.

## Study: Hackers Could Disrupt or Crash HDDs Using Only Sound Waves

- Photo: Getty ImagesWant to destroy video evidence of a break-in, prevent ATMs from logging malware attacks, or simply shut down a critical computer system?

- One possible way to do that might be disrupting hard disk drives with sound waves, either with a specialized device or just by hijacking a nearby speaker.The reason the tactic allegedly works is simple, per Bleeping Computer: Sound waves cause vibrations, and when a sound is played at a specific frequency, it creates a resonance effect that amplifies the vibration effect. Modern hard drives automatically shut off when vibrating to prevent the mechanical arms which perform read-write operations from scratching the data-storage platters and destroying data.

- That, obviously, can seriously disrupt functions on the associated devices or force them to crash.As BleepingComputer noted, Princeton and Purdue university scientists recently demonstrated that such an attack is practical with a specialized audio rig that blasted an HDD drive with acoustic waves at specific angles and at various frequencies.

- Depending on the duration and frequency of the attack, the researchers wrote, they could induce either a temporary fault from which systems recovered or permanent ones requiring a full system reboot.Image: Screengrab via arxiv.orgIn their study, the researchers noted that since HDDs are the most commonly-used type of non-volatile storage due to their enhanced energy efficiency, significantly-improved areal density, and low cost, theres a wide number of systems potentially vulnerable to attack.Image: Screengrab via arxiv.orgThose included both CCTV systems and desktop computers, both of which the researchers showed could be messed with by the sound-wave systemthough disrupting either required a specially designed sound played from a close distance.

- Those difficult conditions make this more of an interesting proof of concept of a previously unproven vulnerability, but as the researchers wrote, Using more powerful sound sources can increase the attack range accordingly. In the CCTV system case, researchers were able to prevent it from recording further camera data, while they were able to drive the desktop computer into a BSOD state.One theoretical application of the attack technique suggested by BleepingComputer would be preventing an afflicted ATM from collecting forensic evidence while fileless malware executes in the ATMs RAM and dispenses cash to attackers, but theres probably lots of ways one could use this maliciously.

- As a result, the researchers recommended that sensitive computer systems come equipped with acoustic shielding for their HDD componentsthough maybe it wouldnt hurt to invest in a solid state drive either.

## Exposed File From Ancestry's RootsWeb.com Contains Data on 300,000 Users

- A file containing hundreds of thousands of RootsWeb users' email, login information, and passwords was found externally exposed, genealogy site says.Ancestry's RootsWeb.com server, which hosts a free genealogical community site, exposed a file containing emails, login information, and passwords of 300,000 users, Ancestry stated in a blog post over the weekend.

- An outside researcher informed the company of the exposed file on Dec. 20, according to Ancestry.

- And while the 300,000 accounts were affiliated with RootsWeb.com's surname list service that it retired earlier this year, 55,000 of the user names belonged to both the free RootsWeb.com site and also to Ancestry.com, which charges for some of its genealogical services.

- The company noted that 7,000 of the emails and log-in credentials belonged to active Ancestry.com users.

- RootsWeb does not host sensitive information like credit card and social security numbers, the company stated, further noting it has "no reason to believe that any Ancestry systems were compromised."

- The company is currently in the process of notifying all affected customers and is working with law enforcement on the matter.

- Ancestry.com subscribers who had their information exposed will need a new password to unlock their account, according to the company.

- Additionally, RootsWeb.com has been taken temporarily offline to enhance its infrastructure, the company notes.

## Oh, shit, Git - httpbit.ly2oGRN9o

-   Oh shit, git!

- Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible.

- Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about in order to fix your problem.

- So here are some bad situations I've gotten myself into, and how I eventually got myself out of them in plain english*.

- git reflog # you will see a list of every thing you've done in git, across all branches!

- # each one has an index HEAD@{index} # find the one before you broke everything git reset HEAD@{index} # magic time machine  You can use this to get back stuff you accidentally deleted, or just to remove some stuff you tried that broke the repo, or to recover after a bad merge, or just to go back to a time when things actually worked.

- I use reflog A LOT.

- Mega hat tip to the many many many many many people who suggested adding it!

## The Docker Bench for Security

-   The Docker Bench for Security is a script that checks for dozens of common best-practices around deploying Docker containers in production.

- The tests are all automated, and are inspired by the CIS Docker Community Edition Benchmark v1.1.0.

- We are releasing this as a follow-up to our Understanding Docker Security and Best Practices blog post.

- We are making this available as an open-source utility so the Docker community can have an easy way to self-assess their hosts and docker containers against this benchmark.

- We packaged docker bench as a small container for your convenience.

- Note that this container is being run with a lot of privilege -- sharing the host's filesystem, pid and network namespaces, due to portions of the benchmark applying to the running host.

- Don't forget to adjust the shared volumes according to your operating system, for example it might not use systemd.

- The easiest way to run your hosts against the Docker Bench for Security is by running our pre-built container: docker run -it --net host --pid host --userns host --cap-add audit_control \ -e DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=$DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST \ -v /var/lib:/var/lib \ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \ -v /usr/lib/systemd:/usr/lib/systemd \ -v /etc:/etc --label docker_bench_security \ docker/docker-bench-security Docker bench requires Docker 1.13.0 or later in order to run.

## Hackers hit key ATM network in crime spree that clears $10 million

-    Enlarge / A timeline of MoneyTaker hacking group.Group-IB  A previously undetected hacker group has netted around $10 million in heists on at least 20 companies, in some cases by targeting the transfer networks banks use to transfer money, a Moscow-based security firm said Monday.

- Members of the MoneyTaker group, named after a piece of custom malware it uses, started its heist spree no later than May 2016.

- That's when it penetrated an unnamed US bank, according to researchers with Group-IB in a report titled MoneyTaker: 1.5 Years of Silent Operations.

- The hackers then used their unauthorized access to control a workstation the bank used to connect to the First Data STAR Network, which more than 5,000 banks use to transact payments involving debit cards.

- MoneyTaker members also targeted an interbank network known as AWS CBR which interfaces with Russia's central bank.

- The hackers also stole internal documents related to the SWIFT banking system, although there's no evidence they have successfully carried out attacks over it.

- Last year, online criminals used stolen SWIFT account credentials to steal $81 million from a bank in Bangladesh.

- Group-IB said the amount of information MoneyTaker has amassed on the Star, SWIFT, and AWS CBR networks raised the possibility the group may be planning more heists that target the interbank payment systems.

## Say Farewell to Putty as Microsoft adds an OpenSSH Client to Windows 10

-  Microsoft Windows OpenSSH Client Cover Ask just about any *NIX admin using a Windows laptop and they will have come across Putty.

- For years, Apple MacBooks have been the go-to choice for many admins partly because getting to a ssh shell is so easy.

- The newly re-invigorated Microsoft is changing how easy it is to interface with Linux (and other *NIX flavors) significantly with features like Ubuntu on Windows.

- There is a new beta feature in Windows 10 that may just see the retirement of Putty from many users: an OpenSSH client and OpenSSH server application for Windows.

- Installing the Windows OpenSSH Client Since this is not the best-documented feature, and still one in Beta, we made a quick video of the installation process.

- If you do not want to watch go to Manage Optional Features then + Add a feature.

- You can then scroll down the list and find the OpenSSH Client (Beta) and OpenSSH Server (Beta) features in Windows.

- The idea of running another remote service on Windows can be daunting so we do not blame you if you do not want to install the server.

## Google's Project Zero reveals Apple jailbreak exploit httpbit.ly2l35GNT

-  Ian Beer of Google's Project Zero has followed up on a coming soon Twitter teaser with a jailbreakable iOS and Mac OS vulnerability.

- Beer went public after Apple worked out a fix for the kernel memory corruption bug.

- He even launched a Twitter account for the occasion:  If you're interested in bootstrapping iOS 11 kernel security research keep a research-only device on iOS 11.1.2 or below.

- Part I (tfp0) release soon.

-  Ian Beer (@i41nbeer) December 5, 2017 (For non-programmers: tfp0 stands for task for pid 0  the kernel task port, and therefore the vector for pwnage.)

- iOS 11.1.2, now with more kernel debugging: https://t.co/PIKbD3Gwx9  Ian Beer (@i41nbeer) December 11, 2017  tfp0 should work for all devices, the PoC local kernel debugger only for those I have to test on (iPhone 7, 6s and iPod Touch 6G) but adding more support should be easy  Ian Beer (@i41nbeer) December 11, 2017 The release is designed to let others take their own toolkits to Apple devices, ultimately to improve their security: if you don't need to jailbreak a device, Apple had already patched the bugs last week.

- The issue Beer found starts with Apple's Mach kernel implementation, and the Mach interface generator (MIG).

- Beer was already familiar with MIG's behaviour, having turned up CVE-2016-7612 and CVE-2016-7633 last year, and in September 2016 wrote: Exploitability hinges on being able to get the memory reallocated in between the two vm_deallocate calls, probably in another thread. A second bug detailed in Beer's proof-of-concept provided the vector to attack MIG.

- Notice The prefetch timing attack I'm using for hid for some reason doesn't work on High Sierra 10.13.2 anymore, and I don't feel like investigating that.

- Maybe patched, maybe just the consequence of a random change, I neither know nor care.

- The vuln is still there and my code does both info leak and kernel r/w, just not in the same binary - reason is explained in the write-up.

- If you want that feature, consider it an exercise for the reader.

- Usage The exploit consists of three parts:  poc panics the kernel to demonstrate the present of a memory corruption, should work on all macOS versions.

- leak leaks the kernel slide, could be adapted to other versions but as-is works only on High Sierra.

## 'Kernel memory leaking' Intel processor design flaw forces Linux, Windows redesign  The Register

-  A fundamental design flaw in Intel's processor chips has forced a significant redesign of the Linux and Windows kernels to defang the chip-level security bug.

- Programmers are scrambling to overhaul the open-source Linux kernel's virtual memory system.

- Meanwhile, Microsoft is expected to publicly introduce necessary changes to its Windows operating system in this month's Patch Tuesday: these changes were seeded to beta testers running fast-ring Windows Insider builds in December.

- Crucially, these updates to both Linux and Windows will incur a performance hit on Intel products.

- The effects are still being benchmarked, however we're looking at a ballpark figure of five to 30 per cent slow down, depending on the task.

- Similar operating systems, such as Apple's 64-bit macOS, will also need to be updated  the flaw is in the Intel x86 hardware, and it appears a microcode update can't address it.

- It has to be fixed in software at the OS level, or buy a new processor without the design blunder.

- Details of the vulnerability within Intel's silicon are under wraps: an embargo on the specifics is due to lift early this month, perhaps in time for Microsoft's Patch Tuesday.

## ROBOT is the return of a 19-year-old vulnerability that allows performing RSA decryption and signing operations with the private key of a TLS server. httpbit.ly2B9Bc2N

-       Paper Play CTF      Return Of Bleichenbacher's Oracle Threat Hanno Bock, Juraj Somorovsky (Hackmanit GmbH, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum), Craig Young (Tripwire VERT)  The Vulnerability ROBOT is the return of a 19-year-old vulnerability that allows performing RSA decryption and signing operations with the private key of a TLS server.

- In 1998, Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered that the error messages given by SSL servers for errors in the PKCS #1 v1.5 padding allowed an adaptive-chosen ciphertext attack; this attack fully breaks the confidentiality of TLS when used with RSA encryption.

- We discovered that by using some slight variations this vulnerability can still be used against many HTTPS hosts in today's Internet.

- How bad is it?

- For hosts that are vulnerable and only support RSA encryption key exchanges it's pretty bad.

- It means an attacker can passively record traffic and later decrypt it.

- For hosts that usually use forward secrecy, but still support a vulnerable RSA encryption key exchange the risk depends on how fast an attacker is able to perform the attack.

- We believe that a server impersonation or man in the middle attack is possible, but it is more challenging.

## Reading privileged memory with a side-channel

-   Posted by Jann Horn, Project Zero   We have discovered that CPU data cache timing can be abused to efficiently leak information out of mis-speculated execution, leading to (at worst) arbitrary virtual memory read vulnerabilities across local security boundaries in various contexts.

- Variants of this issue are known to affect many modern processors, including certain processors by Intel, AMD and ARM.

- For a few Intel and AMD CPU models, we have exploits that work against real software.

- We reported this issue to Intel, AMD and ARM on 2017-06-01 [1].

- So far, there are three known variants of the issue:    Variant 1: bounds check bypass (CVE-2017-5753)   Variant 2: branch target injection (CVE-2017-5715)   Variant 3: rogue data cache load (CVE-2017-5754)     Before the issues described here were publicly disclosed, Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, Yuval Yarom, Paul Kocher, Daniel Genkin, Michael Schwarz, Mike Hamburg, Stefan Mangard, Thomas Prescher and Werner Haas also reported them; their [writeups/blogposts/paper drafts] are at:    Spectre (variants 1 and 2)   Meltdown (variant 3)     During the course of our research, we developed the following proofs of concept (PoCs):    A PoC that demonstrates the basic principles behind variant 1 in userspace on the tested Intel Haswell Xeon CPU, the AMD FX CPU, the AMD PRO CPU and an ARM Cortex A57 [2].

- This PoC only tests for the ability to read data inside mis-speculated execution within the same process, without crossing any privilege boundaries.

- A PoC for variant 1 that, when running with normal user privileges under a modern Linux kernel with a distro-standard config, can perform arbitrary reads in a 4GiB range [3] in kernel virtual memory on the Intel Haswell Xeon CPU.

- If the kernel's BPF JIT is enabled (non-default configuration), it also works on the AMD PRO CPU.

## The NSAs top talent is leaving because of low pay and flagging morale

-    Headquartered at Fort Meade in Maryland, the NSA employs a civilian workforce of about 21,000 there and is the largest producer of intelligence among the nations 17 spy agencies.

- (Patrick Smith/Getty Images)   The National Security Agency is losing its top talent at a worrisome rate as highly skilled personnel, some disillusioned with the spy services leadership and an unpopular reorganization, take higher-paying, more flexible jobs in the private sector.

- Since 2015, the NSA has lost several hundred hackers, engineers and data scientists, according to current and former U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter.

- The potential impact on national security is significant, they said.

- Headquartered at Fort Meade in Maryland, the NSA employs a civilian workforce of about 21,000 there and is the largest producer of intelligence among the nations 17 spy agencies.

- The people who have left were responsible for collecting and analyzing the intelligence that goes into the presidents daily briefing.

- Their work also included monitoring a broad array of subjects including the Islamic State, Russian and North Korean hackers, and analyzing the intentions of foreign governments, and they were responsible for protecting the classified networks that carry such sensitive information.

- Some synonym of the word epidemic is the best way to describe it, said Ellison Anne Williams, a former senior researcher at the NSA who left in 2016 to start her own data-security firm, Enveil.

## Forever 21 Found Malware and Encryption Disabled on its PoS Devices

- Forever 21 Found Malware and Encryption Disabled on its PoS DevicesThe retailer found signs of unauthorized access and malware installed on point-of-sale devices during an investigation into last year's data breach.Forever 21's investigation into a data breach first reported in November 2017 has revealed malware planted on the retailer's point-of-sale systems (PoS) as well as encryption disabled on some of the devices.

- The retailer, which had been using encryption on its payment system since 2015, received a report in mid-October indicating unauthorized access to payment card data at certain stores.

- Following an investigation with payment technology and security firms, Forever 21 said in an update posted late last week that encryption technology on some point-of-sale (PoS) devices was not always on, and that it had found signs of unauthorized network access and malware installed on PoS devices to search for payment card data.

- The malware searched for track data from payment cards as they were processed through the PoS system.

- In most cases this data was limited to card number, expiration date, and internal verification code.

- Occasionally, the cardholder name was also found.

- Encryption had been disabled and malware installed on some devices at varying times in US stores from April 3, 2017 through November 18, 2017.

- Some locations only experienced a breach for a few days or weeks; others were hit for most or all of the timeframe.
